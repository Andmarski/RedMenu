# RedMenu
RedMenu is a server side menu for **[RedM](https://redm.gg/)**. (Soonâ„¢)


This will probably be built with some kind of _Menu Wrapper_ similar to **[MenuAPI](https://github.com/TomGrobbe/MenuAPI/)** for **[FiveM](https://fivem.net/)**, only using the new native menu constructor functions in Red Dead Redemption 2.

The goal will be to have a menu like **[vMenu for FiveM](https://github.com/TomGrobbe/vMenu/)**, but better (both internal code and visual improvements), with more configuration and permission options, made specifically for RedM.
