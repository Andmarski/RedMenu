# RedMenu
RedMenu is a server side menu for RedM. (Soonâ„¢)


This will probably be built with some kind of "Menu API" or "Menu Wrapper" similar to MenuAPI for FiveM, only using the new native menu constructor functions in Red Dead Redemption 2.

The goal will be to have a similar structure like vMenu for FiveM, but better (both internal code and visual improvements), with more configuration and permission options.
